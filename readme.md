# Test-Driven Development By Example in PHP

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.rdok.dev/buildStatus/icon?job=tdd-by-example-php)](https://jenkins.rdok.dev/job/tdd-by-example-php/)

## Local dev
- `git clone git@github.com:rdok/tdd-by-example-php.git`
- `./composer install`
- `./phpunit`

## 1 - Multi-Currency Money
- Make a list of the tests you know you need to have working. These should cover the user story specs.
- Tell a story with a snippet of code about how you want to view one operation.
- Ignore the details of JUnit for the moment
- Make the test compile with stubs
- Make the test run by committing horrible sins
- Gradually generalize the working code, replacing constants with variables
- Add items to your to-do list rather than addressing them all at once
